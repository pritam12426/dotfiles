# My config

This repository serves as my personal data store for configuration files, designed to centralize and manage my setup across various operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.

These configurations are primarily written in a variety of languages, including AutoHotkey (`.ahk`) for Windows, Bash (`.sh`) for shell environments, and Python (`.py`) for general scripting. They are used to customize and configure various settings such as desktop environments, default applications, system utilities, and network parameters, ensuring a consistent and personalized experience across my machines.
